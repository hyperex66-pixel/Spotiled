If your api dosent work and you ran the code it will output  **UNSAFE** . This means the api entered in the code is diffrent from the one on your account.    
Use this -> https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api  | to learn how to get your api key  



Consider Reading the rest of the MD files located in the README directory.  
If your browser just shows **UNSAFE** forever and dosent stop, just go to **Task manager** (**Ctrl + shift + esc**) and search for Spotiled and click on **End task** it will stop.  
To fix it and make it actually work **make sure ur api is right**
